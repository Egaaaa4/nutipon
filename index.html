                    <p class="about_my_works">Here, on this slide, you can see all my recent HTML and CSS work. As a non-native speaker, I am always striving to improve my English language skills and my ability to communicate effectively in a professional setting. I am confident that my technical skills and my dedication to learning will make me a valuable asset to your team. <br><br>
    
                        On the first image, you can see how we completed an assignment using "display-wrap" with the value "wrap". I am particularly proud of this project because it demonstrates my ability to understand and apply complex CSS concepts. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.<br><br>
                        
                        Similarly, on the second image, you can see a similar task, but here we used the command "justify_content" with the values "flex-end" and "flex-start". This project was a great opportunity for me to practice my CSS layout skills. I am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skillset.<br><br>
                        
                        On the third image, you can see a preview of the website we are currently developing. I am excited to be a part of this project and to contribute my skills to creating a beautiful and functional website. I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate with others and learn from their experience.

                            While English may not be my first language, I'm constantly learning and striving to communicate effectively. I believe my dedication to learning, combined with my technical skills, makes me a valuable asset to any team.<br><br>
                            
                            The first project showcases my understanding of complex CSS concepts, using "display-wrap" with the value "wrap." I'm particularly proud of this because it demonstrates my ability to put theory into practice.

                            The second project highlights my CSS layout skills. Here, we used "justify-content" with "flex-end" and "flex-start" for a different layout approach. Every project is a chance to learn and expand my skillset.<br><br>
